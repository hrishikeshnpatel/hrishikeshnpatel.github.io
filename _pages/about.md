Hello! I am Hrishi! A graduate student in Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. I study the physics of how very small things at very cold temperatures can exhibit strange 'Collective phenomena'. These phenomena are often 'emergent' and cannot be explained by a simple reductionist approach. A popular example of a collective phenomenon is [Superconductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity). For a brief primer about the motivation of my research, see [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzwUIrE3edI&t=2687s).

For the more niche audience, my research has typically revolved around the study of superconducting qubits and topological phases in twisted multilayer graphene. Broadly speaking, I am interested in the study of topological materials and how these materials can be used towards real life applications (sensing, simulation, computing, etc.). Recently, I have also been interested in dynamics of quantum circuits. Certain topological properties in solid state systems can be 'simulated' on these circuits and there is a close relationship between entanglement in these circuits and the topology of the system. I have always been interested in many-body and network physics, so my interests in these topics is also a nod to a physicist's blue-sky curiosity.

Outside of my research, I enjoy running, hiking, playing chess and card games and writing. If you would like to talk to me about any of of my above interests, please use the links below :()
